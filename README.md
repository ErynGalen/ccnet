# CCnet
Network protocol for Celeste Classic carts.

## The protocol
See [protocol.scm](protocol/protocol.scm) for more informations.

## Implementing the protocol in carts

See [PICO-8](pico8/README.md) for more information.

There you will also find informations on how to run carts.

The [`carts`](pico8/carts) folder contains carts already modified to work properly.

## Using it
First, the protocol implementation files must be generated.
To do so, run `make protocols`.

Then, in the `server` directory:
* install dependencies by running `npm install`
* compile Typescript files by running `npx tsc`
* run `npm run server`
